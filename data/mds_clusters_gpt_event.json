  "silver_truth": "On September 20, 2022, a United States Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, the USS Higgins, and a Royal Canadian Navy Halifax-class frigate, the HMCS Vancouver, conducted a routine transit through the Taiwan Strait. This operation, which took place amid heightened military tensions between Beijing and Taipei, was carried out through a corridor beyond the territorial sea of any coastal state. The US and Canadian militaries emphasized that such cooperation is central to their approach to ensuring a secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific region. Canada's Defence Minister Anita Anand reiterated her country's commitment to global stability in the region. Taiwan's foreign ministry welcomed the operation, viewing it as a stance against China's expansion attempts. However, China condemned the mission, with its Eastern Theatre Command stating that their forces monitored and warned the ships, remaining on high alert to counter threats and defend national sovereignty. This was the second transit by a US Navy ship in a month and the second joint US-Canada transit in less than a year, following a similar passage in October 2021. The transit occurred shortly after US President Joe Biden reiterated that US troops would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, despite Washington's official policy of strategic ambiguity. The last significant escalation in the region was triggered by a visit to Taiwan by US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi in early August, which led China to conduct military drills near the island.",

  "silver_truth": "On September 21, 2022, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) revised its 2022 growth forecast for developing Asia, reducing it to 4.3% from the earlier projection of 5.2%. This adjustment was attributed to several challenges, including persistent COVID-19 lockdowns in China, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and global efforts to combat inflation. Although easing pandemic restrictions had initially boosted consumer spending and investment in the region, soaring food and fuel prices and increasing interest rates posed significant \"global headwinds\" to economic recovery. ADB's Chief Economist Albert Park highlighted the substantial risks to the region's outlook, including potential financial instability due to stronger-than-expected monetary tightening in advanced economies and China's recurrent lockdowns and a weak property sector. China\u2019s growth forecast was particularly downgraded to 3.3% from 5% due to its stringent zero-COVID policy. Excluding China, the rest of developing Asia is projected to grow by 5.3%, marking the first time in over three decades that the region will outpace China. Additionally, the ADB raised its inflation forecast for the region to 4.5% from 3.7%, driven by the repercussions of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and ongoing supply chain disruptions. The bank emphasized the need for some central banks to further hike interest rates to control inflation and prevent capital outflows.",

Defence Minister Dr. Ng Eng Hen officiated the launch, highlighting the persistent and evolving threat of terrorism due to sophisticated and expanding terrorist networks. He emphasized the necessity of collective intelligence and data-driven methods to counter these threats. Since its operations began in January 2021, CTIF has produced timely intelligence products in collaboration with partner nations, aiding regional security agencies in responding to extremist ideologies. Dr. Ng acknowledged the invaluable contributions of partner nations and stressed the importance of redoubling counter-terrorism efforts, especially as international travel resumes post-Covid-19, potentially increasing the influx of foreign extremists. The facility's location was disclosed to be in Changi, and while many of its operations remain classified for security reasons, its role in synchronizing regional counter-terrorism initiatives is deemed crucial.",

  "silver_truth": "On the evening of September 19, 2022, Juliana Abdul Kadir, a 53-year-old Singaporean woman, was involved in a stand-off with police outside St Hilda's Secondary School in Tampines, Singapore. The police were alerted to the incident at around 6:30 PM. Upon arrival, officers found Juliana uncooperative and refusing to comply with their instructions. During the confrontation, she stabbed herself in the abdomen and threatened further self-harm. To prevent her from causing more injury to herself, a police officer used a Taser on her. Juliana was subsequently arrested for possessing two weapons: a 21cm-long knife and a 13cm penknife blade. She was also suspected of drug-related offenses and detained under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act. The Singapore Civil Defence Force was notified at approximately 6:50 PM, and she was taken to Changi General Hospital in a conscious and stable condition. On September 21, Juliana was charged with possessing dangerous weapons and was remanded for psychiatric observation. Her case is scheduled for a further hearing on October 12. If convicted, she faces up to three years in prison, although she cannot be caned due to her gender.",

However, headline exports dropped by 8.7%, significantly affected by a 14% decline in shipments to China. Despite this, semiconductor sales saw a modest increase of 3.4%. The overall export performance has been sluggish in recent months due to factors such as Russia's war on Ukraine, COVID-19 outbreaks in China, and rapid policy tightening by central banks. The Bank of Korea has been relying on robust overseas sales to control inflation, but trade deficits remain a concern amid high energy prices and a weakening currency. Technology products, which make up a third of South Korean exports, fell by 4.6% last month, with declines in semiconductors, smartphones, and computers. Additionally, the Korea Customs Service reported that South Korea's imports rose by 6.1% in the first 20 days of September, resulting in a trade deficit of $4.1 billion.

Around 12:30pm on April 19, an exhausted Ibrahim fell asleep at the wheel at a junction at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5, running a red light and mounting a kerb. This forced another motorist to brake to avoid a collision. The motorist's passenger approached Ibrahim's van, knocked on the window, and woke him up. Ibrahim admitted he was tired and intended to head home. Despite being advised by a passer-by to wait for the police, Ibrahim continued driving, damaging a railing and a bollard. He was later tracked down by the police and confirmed he was driving during the incident. On September 21, 2022, Ibrahim was sentenced to six days in jail for driving in a rash manner that endangered human life. He was also disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for 15 months.",

Initially targeting residents aged 60 and above, the program will extend to those aged 40-59 over the following two years. Eligible residents will be invited via SMS to enrol with a primary care clinic of their choice. Each enrollee will develop a personalized health plan with their doctor, covering diet, exercise, regular screenings, and vaccinations. The first consultation will be free, and subsequent follow-ups will be subsidized by the government.",

The findings, published in the peer-reviewed journal ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering, revealed that this keratin-cellulose substrate can absorb and retain large amounts of water, making it a promising medium for seed germination and crop growth. Despite its higher production cost compared to commercial substrates, the keratin-based substrate offers the advantage of leaving no waste behind. The research is funded by the Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise under Singapore\u2019s National Research Foundation. The NTU team is currently in discussions with local urban farms to conduct large-scale field tests and hopes to introduce the product to the market within three years.",

The programme also aims to give stray or abandoned animals a chance to socialize with people and potentially be adopted by employees who form a personal connection with them.

Minister for National Development Desmond Lee, speaking at the SPCA's \"Paws for a Cause\" gala benefit dinner, highlighted the mutual benefits of the programme for both animals and people.

The march, which started in September from Kanyakumari and is set to cover over 3,500km to Srinagar, aims to mobilize support ahead of the 2024 national elections. During the rally, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi criticized the government for failing to control inflation and create promised jobs, pointing out the steep rise in LPG cylinder prices from 400 to over 1,000 rupees. He also accused the government of spreading communal hatred. Despite these criticisms, Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains popular, and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is expected to retain power in upcoming state elections in Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat. The Congress party, struggling after consecutive state election losses, plans to elect a new president from outside the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty for the first time in nearly 25 years. Attendees like Raghavendra Gadag expressed hope for the party's resurgence, particularly in Karnataka, amidst concerns over declining living standards due to stagnant incomes and rising prices.",

While hard-copy forms will be accepted in exceptional cases, such as when individuals lack a Singpass account, all LPAs registered before the portal's launch will be converted to digital versions. The changes follow amendments to the Mental Capacity Act passed in Parliament in July 2021. The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has assured robust data protection measures and will provide support through Citizen Connect Centres and ServiceSG Centres.

  "silver_truth": "Support for Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has fallen to its lowest level since he took office in October 2021. This decline is largely attributed to public discontent over the state funeral for former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's connections with the controversial Unification Church. According to various polls, Kishida's approval ratings have dropped significantly, with support rates falling from around 47% in late August to as low as 32.3% in some surveys by mid-September 2022. The assassination of Abe on July 8, 2022, by Tetsuya Yamagami, who blamed Abe for supporting the Unification Church, has intensified scrutiny and criticism of the party's ties to the church. The state funeral, scheduled for September 27, 2022, and its cost of 16.6 billion yen, has also sparked public outrage, with a majority of respondents opposing the decision. Kishida's defense of his actions has not alleviated public dissatisfaction, with a significant portion of the population disapproving of his handling of both the church issue and the funeral arrangements. Analysts suggest that the Prime Minister may face ongoing challenges, including economic pressures and further parliamentary questioning, making recovery from this decline in support difficult.",

The Taiwan Centres for Disease Control's Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang confirmed the possibility of lifting quarantine rules entirely next month. Taiwan had already reduced the quarantine period from seven days to three in June and has recently resumed visa-free entry for certain countries, though a cap of 50,000 arrivals per week remains. Taiwan, which has reported over 5.7 million domestic cases this year primarily due to the Omicron variant, has seen more than 99% of cases exhibiting no or mild symptoms. Consequently, the government has opted to relax restrictions. Taiwan, a previously popular tourist destination for visitors from Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia, is gradually reopening while maintaining some entry controls, such as the requirement for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test upon arrival.",

  "silver_truth": "On September 15, 2022, the US Treasury Department added 22 individuals and two entities to its sanctions blacklist, targeting top Russian finance officials, a neo-Nazi fighter group, and Maria Alexeyevna Lvova-Belova, the Presidential Commissioner for Children's Rights, who is accused of overseeing the deportation and forced adoption of thousands of Ukrainian children into Russian families. The sanctions also included justice officials in occupied Crimea, members of Chechen Republic leader Ramzan Kadyrov's family, and five Russian officials allegedly involved in the theft of Ukrainian grain. In conjunction with the US Commerce Department, the Treasury also banned the export of quantum computing technology and related software and hardware to Russia and Belarus, aiming to degrade Moscow's ability to rebuild its military after suffering heavy losses in the ongoing war with Ukraine. Additionally, sanctions were placed on Russian space, computing, and technology firms, and 31 companies involved in space instrumentation, semiconductor development, and other high-tech sectors were added to the State Department's sanctions list. This comprehensive move by the United States seeks to further isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin and hold perpetrators of violence accountable.",

The floods, described as a once-in-a-hundred-year event likely exacerbated by climate change, submerged a third of the country, affected nearly 33 million people, and caused damages estimated at $30 billion. The National Disaster Management Authority reported over 1,500 deaths, including 536 children and 308 women. As floodwaters began to recede, officials warned that full drainage could take between two to six months. The flood-affected regions have seen a surge in infectious and water-borne diseases, with over 90,000 people treated in a single day. Malaria, dengue fever, diarrhea, and skin problems have become prevalent, especially impacting children and women. The Sindh provincial government reported 588 confirmed malaria cases and thousands of suspected cases, as well as nearly 18,000 diarrhea and 20,000 skin disease cases. Since July 1, 2.3 million patients have been treated in field and mobile hospitals set up in the flooded areas. Millions remain displaced, living in dire conditions with urgent needs for food, shelter, clean water, and medical supplies, often sleeping in the open by elevated highways. Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif highlighted these challenges at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Uzbekistan, underscoring the devastating impact of the floods on the nation.",

  "silver_truth": "On March 1, 2021, Patian Sohag, a 40-year-old Bangladeshi national working in Singapore, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison and three strokes of the cane for abducting and sexually assaulting a 53-year-old sex worker in Geylang. The incident began at around 3:20 am when Patian, having consumed alcohol with friends the previous night, found himself unable to find a sex worker he considered affordable in Geylang. He encountered the victim sleeping on a chair in Geylang Lorong 20 and, seeing no one else around, decided to assault her. Despite the victim's drowsy state from taking 'power pills', Patian molested her and attempted to wake her, but she did not respond. He then carried her to a nearby lane with potted plants and sexually assaulted her. The victim, upon awakening later that morning, discovered the assault and made a police report. A toxicology report confirmed the presence of elevated levels of dextromethorphan and nitrazepam in the victim's blood, indicating that she was indeed in a vulnerable state due to the drugs. Patian's semen was found on the victim's vaginal swabs, and he was arrested on March 4, 2021. The incident was captured on CCTV footage. Patian's case, originally in the High Court, was downgraded to the State Courts. He pleaded guilty to the reclassified charges and expressed remorse for his actions. The prosecutor highlighted the brazen nature of the assault, while the defense argued for a proportionate sentence given the victim's vulnerability as a sex worker. The judge ultimately imposed the sentence, noting the defense lawyer's balanced and fair approach to the case.",

  "silver_truth": "On September 16, 2022, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced sanctions against Ted Colbert, CEO of Boeing Defence, Space, and Security, and Gregory Hayes, CEO of Raytheon Technologies, for their roles in the latest U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. The U.S. State Department had approved the sale on September 2, which included 60 AGM-84L Harpoon Block II anti-ship missiles, 100 AIM-9X Block II Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, and surveillance radar systems, totaling $1.1 billion. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning condemned the arms sales, stating they violate the One-China principle and harm China's sovereignty, security interests, and Sino-U.S. relations. Mao emphasized that the sanctions are to protect China's interests and urged the U.S. to cease military contacts and arms sales to Taiwan. This marks the first time Beijing has specifically identified and sanctioned executives from these companies. The move comes after heightened tensions and military drills around Taiwan following U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit in August. Beijing views Taiwan as a breakaway province, while Taiwan insists on its right to self-determination.",

This innovative vehicle, which combines elements of traditional bicycles and aircraft, can fly for 40 minutes at speeds of up to 100 km/h (62 mph). The XTURISMO, made of carbon fiber and equipped with dual main propellers and four auxiliary propellers, has already been launched in Japan. Aerwins plans to introduce a smaller, lighter version in the U.S. in 2023, priced at $777,000, with ambitions to reduce the cost to $50,000 for an electric model by 2025. Thad Szott, co-chair of the auto show, expressed his excitement after a test hover, likening the experience to riding a speeder bike from \"Star Wars.\" Additionally, Aerwins is pursuing a NASDAQ listing via a merger, valuing the company at $600 million.",

  "silver_truth": "On September 14, 2022, Macau's government concluded the open bidding process for licenses to operate casinos, attracting bids from seven companies, including all six incumbent operators and a surprise submission from GMM Limited, associated with Malaysia's Genting Group. The six incumbents\u2014Sands China, Wynn Macau, Galaxy Entertainment, Melco Resorts, SJM Holdings, and MGM China\u2014each submitted their bids, as did GMM, which does not currently operate casinos in Macau. The bidding process has garnered significant attention due to the fierce competition for only six available licenses. Genting's entry, with a HK$10 million buy-in, introduced additional uncertainty for existing operators, given its strong non-gaming portfolio and significant investments in China, including a ski resort used in the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.",

  "silver_truth": "In October 2019, Malaiyappan Mayalagu, a technician from J. Keart Alliances, failed to switch a water pump to auto mode after a maintenance check at a housing block in Bukit Batok, Singapore. This oversight meant that during a fire on November 1, 2019, the hose reels could not dispense water, as the pump was set to manual mode, requiring a physical button press in the pump room. Residents found the hose reel cabinets padlocked and could not access the hoses, leading to a delay in firefighting efforts. Firefighters eventually used alternative methods to extinguish the fire, which was successfully put out by 5.15am. The fire resulted in the death of an elderly woman due to smoke inhalation injuries after over a month of treatment. Malaiyappan attempted to cover his mistake by resetting the pump to auto mode after the fire and lying about his actions, but CCTV footage revealed the truth. He was fined S$2,700 on September 16, 2022, after pleading guilty to endangering human life and tampering with evidence. District Judge Sharmila Sripathy ruled that he did not deserve jail time, although his negligence was a significant factor in delaying rescue efforts.",

The epicenter was near Taitung County, about 50 kilometers north of the coastal city of Taitung, with a depth of approximately 10 kilometers. The Taiwan Central Weather Bureau reported a slightly lower magnitude of 6.4 and a shallower depth of 7.3 kilometers. The quake was felt across Taiwan, briefly shaking buildings in Taipei. Despite the intensity, there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties. Shops in Taitung experienced items falling off shelves, and a partially collapsed uninhabited house was reported in Hualien County. Taiwan's fire department received no damage reports, and state-run utility Taipower confirmed no interruptions to the electricity supply. Additionally, semiconductor factories in Tainan and Kaohsiung reported no impact on operations. As a precaution, train services between Hualien and Taitung, along with several high-speed rail services and metro systems in Taipei and Kaohsiung, were temporarily suspended for safety checks. Taiwan, located near the junction of two tectonic plates, is prone to earthquakes, with significant quakes in 2016 and 1999 causing substantial casualties.",

  "silver_truth": "On Friday, September 16, 2022, US stock markets ended at two-month lows, with the S&P 500 closing below 3,900, a significant support level. The decline was driven by concerns over inflation, anticipated interest rate hikes, and warnings of a global economic slowdown. FedEx Corporation's disappointing preliminary earnings report, which indicated weak global demand, further exacerbated investor fears, leading to a sharp 21.4% drop in its shares. This drop also affected its peers, including United Parcel Service and XPO Logistics, which slid 4.5% and 4.7%, respectively, while Amazon.com fell 2.1%.",

During these visits to Block 355A, Lim engaged in deep conversations with residents about the challenges in the labor market, especially concerning the new Overseas Networks & Expertise Pass (ONE Pass) scheme introduced by Manpower Minister Dr Tan See Leng. A returning resident from China expressed difficulties in securing a job despite his qualifications and feared that the ONE Pass could worsen locals' chances of climbing the corporate ladder, as foreign nationals often favor their own countrymen. Another resident highlighted the struggle Singaporeans face against lower-paid foreign workers, leading many to turn to alternatives like private hire driving. Lim emphasized that these concerns stem from a sense of disadvantage rather than anti-foreigner sentiments. In Parliament, Dr Tan announced several enhancements to Singapore\u2019s work pass framework, including the introduction of ONE Pass and changes to the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF). Despite these measures, MPs like Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis questioned the effectiveness of FCF and the persistent issue of job discrimination against locals. The discussion underscored the ongoing debate about balancing foreign talent and local employment opportunities in Singapore.",

This brings the total number of charges against Lim to seven. Previously, he was charged with criminal breach of trust for misappropriating S$30,000 awarded to his former client, Mr. Suresh Kumar A Jesupal, in a civil suit settlement between November 14 and December 4, 2019. Lim also faces three charges for acting as a lawyer without a valid practising certificate on 66 occasions between April 1 and June 9, 2021, including a defamation lawsuit hearing involving Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Additionally, he is accused of unlawful stalking for allegedly harassing an ex-employee, Ms. S Priyanka Aunnucia, with inappropriate messages between April and May 2020. Lim's next court appearance is scheduled for October for a pre-trial conference. If convicted of criminal breach of trust as an attorney, he could face up to 20 years in jail and a fine, while refusing to answer a public servant could result in up to six months in jail, a fine of up to S$5,000, or both.",

This meeting, which was open to all international creditors, aimed to provide updates on the country's macroeconomic situation, the reform objectives agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the next steps in the debt restructuring process. The event followed a preliminary agreement made with the IMF on September 1, 2022, for a $2.9 billion loan over 48 months to help Sri Lanka overcome acute shortages of food and fuel that had led to widespread protests and the ouster of then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. During the meeting, officials also announced plans to form an ad-hoc bilateral creditor coordination platform to secure financing assurances from major creditors such as China, Japan, and India. This session marked the first formal engagement with private bondholders since Sri Lanka decided to restructure $13 billion in international sovereign bonds. The success of these restructuring talks is crucial for securing final IMF approval and subsequent funding from other global agencies, which Sri Lanka aims to finalize by December 2022 or early 2023.",

Goh, who was serving his National Service and living with his mother, grandmother, and a domestic helper at Block 7A Commonwealth Avenue, experienced severe hallucinogenic effects after consuming two tabs of LSD. The court heard that Goh, driven by curiosity to see more psychedelic colors, took the second tab of LSD, which led to acute hallucinogen intoxication and a psychotic state characterized by paranoia and reality distortion.",

  "silver_truth": "On September 19, 2022, Typhoon Nanmadol, one of the most powerful storms to hit Japan in years, wreaked havoc across the southwestern regions, including Kagoshima and Kyushu. The typhoon, which packed winds of up to 234 km/h and brought record rainfall, resulted in at least two confirmed deaths, numerous injuries, and widespread destruction. One man was found dead in a flooded car, and another died in a landslide. The storm caused significant transport disruptions, including the suspension of Kyushu's bullet-train services and the cancellation of around 800 flights by Japan Airlines and ANA Holdings. Approximately 340,000 households lost power, while nearly 10 million people were ordered to evacuate, with 20,000 seeking shelter in Kagoshima and Miyazaki prefectures. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida delayed his trip to the United Nations General Assembly to manage the crisis. Scientists noted that climate change is likely exacerbating the severity of such typhoons. The typhoon also triggered landslides, floods, and extensive damage to infrastructure, including downed electric lines and collapsed buildings. The Japan Meteorological Agency issued a rare \"special warning\" for extreme weather conditions, urging continued vigilance against heavy rains, high waves, and storm surges.",

Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, Grace Fu, emphasized the importance of national collaboration to tackle increasing extreme weather events and their impacts on energy, food production, urban heat, and sea levels. Singapore's approach includes building sea walls and reducing emissions, though these are long-term investments. Discussions will focus on sustainable economic growth and equitable distribution to ensure no one is left behind. A gradual increase in carbon tax will support greener production methods and mitigate price impacts on households. Ensuring that Singaporeans are not disadvantaged during this transition is crucial, with upskilling and reskilling initiatives being essential. The success of Singapore's green transition hinges on the collective efforts of the government, businesses, the community, and individuals.

  "silver_truth": "In China, a significant mortgage protest emerged in late June 2022 as many homebuyers stopped repaying their loans to protest stalled construction on their properties. This rare act of public disobedience was spread via social media, prompting regulators to offer six-month loan payment holidays and promises to expedite construction. Despite these assurances, a lack of progress at numerous sites has led more buyers to join the boycott. Notably, Mr. Wang Wending from Zhengzhou postponed his mortgage payments but faced uncertainty as construction had not commenced. By mid-September, homebuyers in at least 100 cities had threatened to halt payments, and the number of projects involved rose to 342 from 319 in late July, according to a GitHub list titled \"We Need Home.\"",

  "silver_truth": "Since the beginning of 2022, the Singapore dollar has emerged as the most resilient currency in Asia against the US dollar, despite having depreciated by over 4% against the greenback. This resilience is attributed to the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) approach of using the exchange rate rather than interest rates to combat rising core inflation, which hit a 14-year high in July. Notable financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and MUFG Bank are optimistic about further strengthening of the Singapore dollar, contingent on MAS extending its policy tightening in its October meeting. MUFG Bank's Jeff Ng estimates a 50% chance of further policy tightening, which could lead to a more than 1% appreciation of the Singapore dollar against the US dollar in subsequent months. MUFG forecasts the currency to reach 1.38 per US dollar by year-end, compared to its recent close of 1.4070.",

The company aims to raise between HK$54.9 billion and HK$61.5 billion (approximately US$783.5 million) by offering 116.7 million shares priced between HK$47.1 and HK$52.7 each. This IPO is expected to be the biggest on the Hong Kong market in 2022, surpassing earlier offerings like Huitongda Network's US$297 million IPO in February. Onewo, previously known as Vanke Property Development Co., provides residential property services, commercial and urban space integrated services, and AI-driven business process outsourcing solutions. The funds raised will be used to expand Onewo's business, develop AIoT and BPaaS solutions, invest in value-added service providers, and attract talent. The IPO has attracted cornerstone investors such as Temasek, UBS Asset Management, China Chengtong Investment, and China's Mixed Ownership Reform Fund, committing a total of US$280 million. Onewo's shares are set to be priced on September 22 and commence trading on September 29. The IPO is seen as a critical test for investor appetite in China's beleaguered real estate market, which has seen several developers default on debt. However, Vanke has remained resilient, partly due to lower debt levels and partial state ownership. The IPO is not intended to raise liquidity for Vanke but rather to bolster Onewo's business expansion and technological upgrades.",

The police received a call for assistance around 6:30 pm regarding the woman's erratic behavior near Block 840, Tampines Street 82. When officers arrived, the woman was uncooperative and refused to follow their instructions. During the standoff, she alternated between shouting and speaking in a mix of English and Malay, and at one point, she made a phone call and dropped something from her hand. Subsequently, she stabbed herself in the abdomen and threatened further self-harm. To prevent her from injuring herself further, a police officer discharged a Taser. The woman was then subdued and arrested by at least ten officers, some in tactical gear and holding submachine guns, with one officer using a transparent police shield. Passers-by observed the incident, and traffic was directed by a police officer. The Singapore Civil Defence Force was alerted at about 6:50 pm and transported the woman to Changi General Hospital, where she was conscious and in stable condition. She was arrested for possession of an offensive weapon in a public place, suspected drug-related offenses, and was also apprehended under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act.

Provinces like Jilin and regions across China, except Shanghai, reported fiscal deficits, exacerbated by massive tax breaks to support businesses and the high costs of Covid containment. Plummeting land sales further squeezed revenues, prompting local governments to cut spending, including slashing bonuses for government employees and delaying payments to Covid-19 testing providers. The economic slowdown was compounded by a yearlong property market slump and constrained fiscal spending, impeding stimulus efforts. The National Development and Reform Commission noted the economy's fragile recovery, despite some improvement in August with unexpected growth in factory output and retail sales. To boost consumption, Shanghai and Hainan announced the issuance of 100 million yuan in vouchers. The central government increased financial support to local authorities, but economic uncertainties persisted, with forecasters like Morgan Stanley and Barclays predicting slower growth. The situation underscored the challenges of balancing fiscal health with stringent Covid policies and economic recovery.",

Aw bought two fake Rolex watches for S$800 and S$850 each and successfully pawned them at a Marsiling pawn shop on July 15, 2021. He deceived the shop into believing the watches were genuine, receiving S$18,000 for a Rolex Submariner and S$16,500 for a Rolex Deep Sea Dweller. The next day, fearing suspicion, Aw enlisted a friend to pawn a third fake Rolex Submariner for S$18,000. Aw used some of the cash to buy gold. The pawn shop eventually discovered the scam and reported it to the police. Aw's friend was apprehended and sentenced in February 2022. When Aw was arrested, authorities seized a gold amulet, a gold chain, and S$4,300 in cash. The pawn shop accepted gold and cash worth about S$31,700 as partial restitution but incurred a remaining loss of about S$20,000. Aw, who has a criminal history dating back to 2002, pleaded guilty to two counts of cheating and an unrelated charge of carrying a stun gun. The prosecutor sought 10 months' jail and a S$3,000 fine, highlighting the premeditated nature of the crimes and Aw's involvement of an accomplice. Aw's defense requested a shorter jail term, citing his remorse and family responsibilities. The judge postponed sentencing to the following month.",

  "silver_truth": "On September 18, 2022, during a CBS \"60 Minutes\" interview, President Joe Biden declared that \"the pandemic is over,\" despite the United States still facing daily COVID-19 deaths. He pointed out that no one was wearing masks at the Detroit auto show, indicating a return to normalcy. However, Biden acknowledged ongoing issues with COVID-19 and the need for continued efforts to manage it. His comments sparked significant backlash from the public and health experts, who argued his statements were premature and not scientifically grounded. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported nearly 400 daily deaths from COVID-19, and experts like Dr. Michael Osterholm emphasized the virus remains a major health threat. Biden and his wife Jill had both contracted COVID-19 recently, experiencing mild cases, which he attributed to improved healthcare under his administration. Biden's declaration has raised concerns about its potential impact on public perception and policy, especially as the White House seeks additional $22.4 billion funding from Congress to prepare for possible future surges. The World Health Organization and its Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, maintain that the pandemic is not yet over, despite signs of improvement.",

The Taliban's acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi expressed hope that the exchange would mark a \"new era\" in US-Taliban relations. The Biden administration, under pressure from families of Americans detained by hostile governments, has been actively negotiating the release of US detainees worldwide, including with Russia, Syria, and Venezuela. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken thanked Qatar for its role in the successful negotiation. Noorzai, who denied drug dealing charges, expressed pride in returning to Afghanistan.

The Ethereum blockchain had recently undergone a major upgrade called the Merge, which reduced its energy consumption but led to a sell-the-news reaction among investors, contributing to Ether's drop. Additionally, remarks from SEC Chairman Gary Gensler hinted that the new structure might attract extra regulation, further unsettling the market. Reports indicated that Ripple Labs and the SEC are seeking an immediate court ruling regarding XRP, causing XRP to plummet by around 12%. Investors are bracing for volatility due to an expected jumbo interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve to combat inflation.

  "silver_truth": "On September 19, 2022, a Singaporean court sentenced a 42-year-old man to seven years in prison and six strokes of the cane for molesting and sexually assaulting a bride on her wedding night. The incident occurred in October 2016 at a downtown hotel. The man, who cannot be named due to a gag order, was a groomsman at the wedding. The bride, who had been drinking with her wedding party in the bridal suite, retired to the bedroom at around 1am to shower and sleep. The groomsman, who had also been drinking, fell asleep on a sofa in the living room. The bride later awoke to find someone touching her inappropriately, and realized it was not her husband. She left the room and found the groomsman outside. The couple has since divorced, although the court did not specify whether this was related to the incident. The groomsman claims he was asleep at home and mistook the bride for his wife, but the judge did not believe his story and sentenced him accordingly. The man intends to appeal the verdict.",

The incident occurred on March 9, 2022, when Pang, frustrated upon finding Car Park 10 full, returned on foot and vandalized the car parked in lot 234. The damage amounted to S$428, which Pang later compensated fully. Court documents revealed that Pang had committed a similar act on March 1, 2022, scratching another car in the same lot. During sentencing, District Judge Wong Li Tein noted Pang's actions were unwarranted and that he had committed two offences in the span of a week. However, she considered his remorse, restitution, and early plea of guilt. Pang cited stress from his father's hospitalization and work-related issues as factors contributing to his behavior. For mischief, he faced a potential jail term of up to two years, a fine, or both.",

Thirteen years later, in 2020, a breakthrough in the case led to the arrest of Ahmad Danial Mohamed Rafa\u2019ee, who was subsequently charged with her murder. However, due to the ongoing fugitive status of his accomplice, Ragil Putra Setia Sukmarahjana, Ahmad Danial was granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal for the murder charge in June 2022. This legal status allows for re-prosecution if new evidence surfaces. Despite this, Ahmad Danial was sentenced on October 14, 2022, to 26 months in jail for lesser charges, including depositing Teo's corpse, misappropriating her belongings, fabricating false evidence, and giving false evidence to the police. His accomplice Ragil remains at large.",

  "silver_truth": "In October 2022, the Malaysian government announced its decision to continue pursuing legal action at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to claim sovereignty over Pedra Branca, an island whose ownership has been contested between Malaysia and Singapore. This decision followed recommendations from a special committee reviewing legal aspects of the sovereignty dispute over Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks, and South Ledge. The committee's report, presented to the Malaysian Cabinet on October 7, 2022, suggested that former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's alleged negligence resulted in Malaysia missing the opportunity to seek judicial review of the ICJ's 2008 ruling, which awarded Pedra Branca to Singapore and Middle Rocks to Malaysia, with no decision made on South Ledge. Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded on October 14, 2022, affirming Singapore's readiness to robustly defend its sovereignty over Pedra Branca and highlighting that both countries had initially agreed to abide by the 2008 ICJ decision. The dispute originally dates back to 1979, with Malaysia previously filing applications in 2017 to revise and interpret the ICJ judgment, which were withdrawn in 2018.",
