  "silver_truth": "In Singapore, a series of disturbing events unfolded involving a man who, starting at the age of 16, sexually assaulted three teenage girls and later harassed his ex-girlfriend extensively. The man, now 22 years old, was given 21 months of probation on September 22, 2022, after pleading guilty to multiple charges including sexual penetration of a minor under 16, unlawful stalking, and threatening to distribute intimate images. His initial offenses occurred in 2016, where he exploited the vulnerabilities of two girls aged 13 and 15 by sexually assaulting them under pretenses of needing emotional support. In subsequent years, he harassed another girlfriend whom he started dating in 2018. His harassment escalated to threats of suicide, uninvited appearances at her workplace, and even threats to distribute explicit photos and videos of her online. These offenses were brought to light in 2018 after he confided in a mentor from a youth group. As part of his probation, the man is required to perform 60 hours of community service, attend psychological treatment, and his internet devices will be monitored. This case highlights serious issues of sexual and emotional abuse among youth, and the legal outcomes that followed.",

This test kit, which requires only a drop of blood, can detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, much faster than conventional laboratory tests that take 24 to 72 hours. The kit is described as low-cost and can be easily adapted for new COVID-19 variants and other diseases in the future. It is designed to be administered by individuals without medical training and does not require specialized laboratory equipment, facilitating large-scale testing especially among vulnerable groups such as the elderly. The test also helps inform individuals about their need for caution regarding potential infection and the timing for booster shots based on detected antibody levels, paving the way for personalized vaccination strategies. As of the report date, 93% of Singapore\u2019s population had completed full vaccination, with about 80% having received a booster shot. Further development is ongoing to meet regulatory approvals and manufacturing standards for public use, and a start-up named Thrixen has been established to commercialize the product.",

The test was necessary for the Malaysian man, Goh Ah Hock, who wanted to convert his Malaysian driving license to a Singaporean one. Goh, a construction worker, was not confident he could pass the test and therefore hired an unidentified agent for S$500 to arrange for someone else to take the test in his place. On June 28, 2022, Goh met the agent outside the Singapore Safety Driving Centre (SSDC) in Woodlands, handed over his work permit, and waited at a nearby coffee shop. Zhang, after receiving Goh's work permit from the agent, attempted to take the test. However, the test administrator became suspicious when Zhang could not match the photo on the permit and failed to provide Goh\u2019s FIN number. Consequently, Zhang left the room and returned with Goh, after which the police were called. Both men were arrested, and Zhang was sentenced to two months in jail for attempted cheating on July 21, 2022. Goh was also sentenced to two months in jail on September 22, 2022, for abetting the offense of cheating by personation. Goh's lawyer argued that his client played a passive role compared to Zhang. The identity of the involved agent remains unknown.",

The storm caused widespread flooding and landslides in Puerto Rico, where most of the 3.3 million residents were left without power and water, and up to eight people died. The devastation recalled memories of Hurricane Maria in 2017, which killed around 3,000 people. In response, President Joe Biden approved a disaster declaration for Puerto Rico to provide federal funding for affected individuals. As of midday Wednesday, approximately 1.07 million homes and businesses remained without power, with full restoration expected to take several days. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported that Fiona reached wind speeds of up to 215 km/h and was expected to strengthen as it moved north towards Bermuda. Eric Blake from the NHC warned that Bermuda would experience high surf, storm surges, heavy rainfall, and powerful winds, even if Fiona did not make a direct hit. The Bermuda Weather Service issued a tropical storm warning, and Deputy Director Michelle Pitcher emphasized the island\u2019s preparedness for severe weather. Fiona was also projected to impact Canada\u2019s Atlantic provinces of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Labrador by Friday, posing significant risks to these regions.",

Dialog immediately shut down its servers upon detecting the breach, restarted them two days later, and hired cybersecurity experts to investigate and monitor the dark web for further data exposure. Singtel assured that Dialog's systems are completely independent from those of Optus, another Australian subsidiary, which also suffered a massive data breach in late September affecting up to 9.8 million customers. Singtel emphasized there was no evidence linking the two incidents. Dialog is actively supporting affected individuals to protect against fraud.",

However, the new policy, effective since July 15, 2022, now allows these employees to take temporary ground positions during their pregnancy, ranging from three to nine months. This shift is designed to support cabin crew during and after their pregnancy. After giving birth and completing maternity leave, which lasts up to 16 weeks, they can resume their flying duties. If their contract expires during pregnancy, they will be offered a one-year contract renewal. This move aims to retain talent and ensure the provision of world-class service. Women's groups, including the Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware), have lauded this change, describing it as a long-overdue improvement that aligns SIA with the practices of other airlines. The policy change addresses criticisms that the previous practice was discriminatory and unjustifiable.",

The Law Society of Singapore (LawSoc) had brought several charges against Mr. Lun, who, despite being a solicitor of eight years, breached the Legal Profession (Admission) Rules 2011 by supervising Mr. Lim Teng Jie and Ms. Trinisha Ann Sunil during their training at Foxwood LLC between October 2019 and January 2020. After discovering his lack of qualifications, Mr. Lun continued to assign work to the trainees and pressed Ms. Sunil for her notice period payment when she wished to leave. The disciplinary hearing debated the duration it took Mr. Lun to inform the trainees of his unqualified status, with his lawyer suggesting a fine instead of suspension, while LawSoc's lawyer advocated for a shorter suspension. Chief Justice Menon emphasized the harm caused to the trainees and clients due to Mr. Lun's actions, highlighting his careless attitude and failure to promptly address the issue. The court also ordered Mr. Lun to pay S$10,000 in costs to LawSoc and allowed his suspension to commence on November 7, 2022, after he completes a trial.",

This decision, made during a pre-trial conference on October 7, 2022, follows his charges in November 2020 for giving false evidence and furnishing false information in the case involving his former domestic worker, Parti Liyani. Parti Liyani was initially convicted of stealing S$34,000 worth of items from the Liew family and sentenced to 26 months in jail; however, her conviction was overturned by the High Court in September 2020, which found several issues with the case, including a break in the chain of evidence and Liew's lack of credibility as a witness. Karl Liew is accused of lying about the ownership of certain clothing items and fabricating evidence. He has been released on bail of S$15,000, with his next pre-trial conference scheduled for December 9, 2022. If convicted, he faces up to seven years in prison and fines.",

The central bank indicated that key monetary policy targets such as economic growth, prices, employment, and balance of international payments are within reasonable ranges, suggesting that current interest rates are appropriate. On the same day, China maintained its benchmark lending rates, the one-year loan prime rate (LPR) at 3.65% and the five-year LPR at 4.30%, aligning with market expectations. This decision follows the PBOC's recent move to keep its medium-term policy rate unchanged and reduce banking system liquidity, as policymakers aim to balance economic support with risk management. Despite August's rate cuts to counteract economic slowdowns caused by a property crisis and COVID-19 resurgence, these cuts accelerated the yuan's depreciation, which has fallen about 4% against the dollar since mid-August, breaching the 7 per dollar threshold and raising capital outflow concerns. The LPR, determined monthly by 18 designated commercial banks, influences most new and outstanding loans and mortgage pricing in China.",

In the first case, Advocate General Athanasios Rantos suggested that antitrust authorities might consider compliance with EU data protection rules during their investigations. This opinion, if adopted by the CJEU, could strengthen the German competition agency's stance against Meta Platforms, which has been embroiled in a legal battle since 2019 over allegations of abusing market power by collecting user data without consent. The German court had sought guidance from the CJEU on whether the antitrust agency overstepped its authority. The final judgment is awaited, but it could set a precedent for other EU countries to scrutinize Big Tech under privacy rules.",

The case stemmed from February 2019 when Mr. Heng Cheng Hock, the director of A-TEC Motorz, was charged under the Road Traffic Act. Mr. Heng directed Chua, his administrator, to handle the fines related to the charges. However, Chua failed to settle the case with the Land Transport Authority (LTA), leading to a warrant of arrest for Mr. Heng. Chua then handed Mr. Heng a forged payment slip dated April 16, 2019, falsely claiming he had paid the fine on his boss's behalf. Discrepancies in the slip were noted when Mr. Heng presented it in court on May 28, 2019, prompting an investigation that revealed the document was forged. Despite Chua's persistent claims that he had gone to court to plead guilty on behalf of Mr. Heng, evidence showed he went for his own LTA case. The court found that it was impossible for Chua to represent Mr. Heng, especially with an active warrant against him. Mr. Heng eventually paid a composition sum of S$250 and was acquitted by LTA. Chua's lack of remorse and the deliberate nature of the forgery led the prosecution to call his defense \"ridiculous.\" Chua was allowed to defer his sentence to October.",

  "silver_truth": "On August 31, 2022, Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) secretary-general Toshimitsu Motegi announced that all LDP lawmakers must cut ties with the controversial Unification Church. This decision comes amid increasing scrutiny and a drop in the government's approval ratings, which have plunged to around 30 percent due to revelations of connections between LDP members and the church. A recent survey by Japan's Kyodo News found that 106 out of 712 lawmakers had associations with the church, and an LDP internal survey revealed 179 out of 379 members had interacted with the church. The scrutiny intensified following the assassination of former premier Shinzo Abe, whose suspected killer blamed him for supporting the church, which had allegedly bankrupted his mother. In response to the scandal, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida reshuffled his cabinet last month, removing seven ministers with church ties. Despite these efforts, Economy Minister Daishiro Yamagiwa admitted on September 20, 2022, that he had attended a church event in 2018, which he had not previously disclosed. Amid the ongoing controversy, public dissatisfaction with Kishida\u2019s handling of the issue is high, with nearly two-thirds of respondents in a recent Jiji news agency survey expressing disapproval.",

This move follows a series of data breaches and investigations involving government institutions and private firms, including a state insurer, a telecom company, a public utility, and a COVID-19 contact-tracing app that exposed President Joko Widodo's vaccination records. The Bill, supported overwhelmingly by lawmakers, authorizes the President to establish an oversight body to enforce the rules, with potential fines reaching 2% of a corporation's annual revenue and the possibility of asset confiscation or auction. The law, which has been in development since 2016, also includes a two-year adjustment period and aims to enhance cyber security among government and private entities. Communications Minister Johnny G Plate highlighted that the Bill ushers in a new era for personal data management in Indonesia, particularly in the digital domain. Experts believe the legislation will push institutions to prioritize data protection, though some, like Wahyudi Djafar from the Institute for Policy Research and Advocacy, question if the penalties are stringent enough. The law draws inspiration from European Union regulations and positions Indonesia as the fifth Southeast Asian nation to enact specific personal data protection laws, following Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines.",

This move, seen as discriminatory by Seoul, is argued to violate the US-South Korea Free Trade Agreement's most-favored-nation treatment clause. South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo suggested seeking alternative solutions before resorting to legal actions. The issue overshadowed South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol's first official visit to the US, which began on September 19, 2022, and included attendance at the UN General Assembly and meetings with President Joe Biden. President Yoon planned to address concerns about the IRA, including requesting a postponement of the new rules until Hyundai completes its Georgia factory in 2025. Despite high-level efforts and discussions, including mobilization of South Korean officials and a meeting between US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and South Korean counterpart Kim Sung-han, a resolution remained elusive. The controversy also complicated broader diplomatic efforts, such as improving relations with Japan and addressing North Korea's nuclear threats, which President Yoon intended to discuss during his trip.",

One of the patients, 57-year-old Lim Ya Sheng, experienced severe side effects, including headache, increased heart rate, vision problems, and muscle cramps, and was hospitalized for four days. The other patient did not report any adverse reactions. The undiluted vaccine vials contained five doses each. The Ministry of Health (MOH) was informed of the incident on September 19 and has suspended the clinic and the doctor involved from the National Vaccination Programme pending a thorough investigation. The doctor responsible was a locum with two years of intermittent service at the clinic. The MOH emphasized the seriousness of the incident, recalling past similar occurrences, including a case at the Singapore National Eye Centre in January 2021 where a staff member received five doses in one injection due to human error. Another incident involved 117 patients at Bukit Merah Polyclinic receiving only one-tenth of the recommended vaccine dose in October 2021.",

This request follows the collapse of TerraUSD and Luna cryptocurrencies in May 2022, which caused significant financial losses globally and particularly affected 280,000 South Korean investors. The implosion of these digital currencies, previously pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, led to a broader downturn in the cryptocurrency market. Do Kwon, who left South Korea for Singapore and whose current whereabouts are unknown, is accused of violating South Korea's capital market laws and possibly committing fraud. Despite his public claims of full cooperation, prosecutors report that he has not been forthcoming with investigators and has no intention of appearing for questioning. The South Korean Foreign Ministry is also processing requests to revoke the passports of Kwon and four other suspects. His Singapore employment pass is set to expire on December 7, 2022. The incident has intensified regulatory scrutiny and prompted broader discussions on risk management within the crypto industry.",

  "silver_truth": "A recent study published on September 20, 2022, and led by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) revealed that many densely populated coastal cities worldwide are experiencing significant land subsidence, exacerbating the effects of global sea-level rise and increasing flood risks. The study utilized Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology to analyze satellite images of 48 coastal cities with populations over five million from 2014 to 2020. The researchers found that the median land subsidence rate is 16.2mm per year, with some cities sinking up to 43mm annually, while the global sea-level rise is currently at 3.7mm per year. The fastest-sinking cities are predominantly in Asia, especially Southeast Asia, with Ho Chi Minh City and Tianjin experiencing the highest subsidence rates. Factors such as groundwater extraction and infrastructure development are identified as primary causes of the subsidence. The findings, published in Nature Sustainability, suggest that land subsidence combined with sea-level rise could result in more frequent and severe flooding, posing significant risks to property, infrastructure, and livelihoods in vulnerable areas. The study emphasizes the need for tailored mitigation strategies, including building coastal defenses and addressing the root causes of subsidence, to manage these risks effectively.",

The price increase will affect all euro zone countries as well as Sweden, Poland, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, South Korea, Vietnam, and Chile. This adjustment is partly due to new regulations in countries like Vietnam, which now require tax collection from consumers. The new starting prices in the euro zone will rise from 99 euro cents to 1.19 euros. This price hike follows a period of significant economic challenges, including a rapid rise in inflation, interest rates, and energy prices, which have weakened currencies like the yen and the euro. The euro, in particular, has dropped to two-decade lows and has been trading around parity with the dollar. Apple, which recently launched its latest generation of iPhones, has been focusing on growing its services business, including the App Store, to reduce reliance on iPhone sales. This services segment has been generating about $20 billion per quarter in revenue.",

UNICEF reports that 16 million children are affected, with 3.4 million in need of immediate, lifesaving support. The disaster has destroyed critical infrastructure, including 18,000 schools and numerous hospitals, leaving millions without access to education and essential services. The situation is dire, with widespread outbreaks of water-borne diseases such as malaria, diarrhoea, and dengue fever. Over 2.7 million people have been treated for these diseases, with makeshift hospitals struggling to cope. UNICEF and local officials emphasize the urgent need for food, shelter, clean water, and medical supplies. The psychological impact on children is severe, with risks of post-traumatic stress disorder due to the loss of routine and security. Efforts are underway to provide humanitarian aid and social support, but the scale of the disaster presents significant challenges, with winter approaching and many areas still inaccessible due to floodwaters.",

The woman, aged 53, was seen waving the knife and stabbing herself in the abdomen during a standoff with police officers. Despite verbal commands from the officers to drop the knife, she continued to threaten self-harm, even placing the knife on her neck. The situation escalated, leading one officer to subdue her using a Taser. Following her arrest, two knives, measuring 21 cm and 13 cm, were confiscated from her. The woman was subsequently taken to Changi General Hospital by the Singapore Civil Defence Force. She faces charges for possession of offensive weapons in a public place, which can result in a jail term of up to three years and at least six strokes of the cane, although she is exempt from caning due to her gender. Additionally, she is under investigation by the Central Narcotics Bureau for suspected drug-related offences. She is scheduled to appear in court on Wednesday, September 21, 2022.",

  "silver_truth": "In August 2022, China's imports of Russian coal surged to 8.54 million tonnes, the highest monthly figure since 2017 and a 57% increase compared to the same period in 2021. This spike was driven by Europe's suspension of Russian coal purchases following Russia's military actions in Ukraine, leading to steep discounts on Russian coal. Despite price increases, Russian coal remained cheaper than domestic alternatives, with 5,500 kcal thermal coal priced at about $155 per tonne in late August. Severe drought and heatwave in western and southern China from late July further fueled demand, prompting coal-fired power plants to ramp up production and purchase higher-quality coal like Russian coal to enhance efficiency. Similarly, China's imports of Indonesian coal rose by 35% from July to 15.82 million tonnes in August, although this was still lower than the 17.3 million tonnes imported in August 2021. Lucrative prices incentivized utilities to increase their orders. However, the ongoing depreciation of the renminbi could make imported coal more expensive for Chinese buyers, potentially affecting future demand.",

The woman, diagnosed with untreated schizophrenia, was experiencing auditory hallucinations, with voices telling her that her daughter was an evil spirit who needed to be killed. The attack, witnessed by the victim's four-year-old sister, left the elder daughter with 76 stab wounds. The woman was found naked and holding a pair of scissors when her brother discovered the scene. She was arrested and charged with murder, but the High Court on September 20, 2022, acquitted her due to her mental incapacity. Instead, she will be indefinitely confined to a psychiatric institution, prison, or another suitable location at the discretion of the President, as per Section 252 of the Criminal Procedure Code.",
